# Syntax coloring files for touist

This project contains the .tmLanguage for sublime text, vscode and textmate. I created this repo to centralize the tmlanguage.

To build the .tmLanguage and JSON-tmLanguage from the YAML-tmLanguage, go into `build` and run

    npm install

or, if you have already run `npm install`:

    npm build
