Touist for vscode
=================

This project adds support for the touist language to vscode. It mainly consists
of a syntax coloring feature (through the touist.tmLanguage file).

This tmLanguage could also be used in other editors (textmate, sublime text) but
I didn't write a package/extension specifically for them; feel free to pick the
tmLanguage for any other editor!

## Contribute

If you to fix the syntax file `touist.tmLanguage`, you can use the
`touist.YAML-tmLanguage` file to do so and then go into `build` and run

    npm install
    npm start

to compile yaml into tmLanguage. The JSON-tmLanguage is also generated in
case it can help for adding syntax support to an other editor.
